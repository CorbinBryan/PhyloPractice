# A Brief Primer on Phylogenetic Theory and Practice 
This repository contains a short primer on the intuition behind phylogenetics as well as a guided sample phylogenetics workflow. The following programs should be installed: 
* [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) (or another conda distribution of your choice)  

The following software are optional, but helpful: 
* [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) or ggtree (a tree visualization package available for R)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (helpful for writing reproducible scripts and keeping track of your own workflow)

To get started, see `phylo.md` in the root of this repository.
